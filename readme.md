## How to modify
This mod plays the music file with the path `music/hddead.mp3`. Just change that file if you want different music.

Death message titles are loaded from filenames that start with `deathmessages`.   
All titles are seperated by a newline.

Death subtitles are loaded from filenames that start with `deathsubtitles`.   
All subtitles are seperated by a newline.

It should be noted that you can use colour codes specified in the [ZDoom Print wiki page](https://zdoom.org/wiki/Print#Colors).
